## Vision
Our vision for this project is to work with collaborators to build curricula, resources, and community for school kits/clubs so students and teachers in rural, underserved, and underrepresented areas can access and learn skills in tech.

School Kits/Clubs is an open project to bring expertise from all over the globe in creating diverse and inclusive support for schools and informal educators in rural and developing areas.

## About Us

As a US-based nonprofit, [ChickTech](https://chicktech.org) is dedicated to retaining women in the technology workforce and increasing the number of women and girls pursuing technology-based careers. Through our programs for K-12 students, we strive to bring tech opportunities to girls in order to build confidence and learn that they can be a tech-creator.  

The School Kits and Club project is our response to meeting the needs of all girls, no matter their location, background, or access to tech opportunities through their schools and community. As we began developing a rural pilot program, we heard the need for large-scale community connection and curricula for educators in order to make tech accessible for all, which brings us to the development of the School Kit and Clubs project.

As project lead, Katie is working with a team to further develop our rural program on the ground in Oregon, USA.  Through outreach in chapters across the country, she has been working with teachers in rural areas across the country, who have been expressing a need for support in getting girls into tech.  To reach Katie to discuss ideas for the project, email her at [katie.sanfilippo@chicktech.org](katie.sanfilippo@chicktech.org).

## What we're working on and how to get started

## Contributing on Projects
The ChickTech Clubs/Kits project has two contributing teams - Curricula Revision and Community Forum Creation.  Check out below for info on each and letâ€™s get started!

## Curriculum Revision
ChickTech's current curriculum is based on a 10-hour workshop model.  We need to tailor this to meet the needs of School Clubs and other educators with different schedules.  While we are at it, let's make sure the curriculum is fully inclusive so accommodations are listed for students with different abilities, lack of reliable internet in the classroom, teachers with little to no tech background, etc! Have more ideas? Start contributing on the Curricula Revision!!! 

For more details: View the [Curricula Contributing.md](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wW-mWtxwgFaqc-d-cMUlkLY0fG_w42Rw1fBX9sNjlH4/edit)

## Community Forum
The community forum will be a virtual gathering place for educators, ChickTech community members, and students to connect, share resources, and support each other in making tech-education accessible for all. We need your suggestions in tools to use, your expertise in creating the forum, and your feedback to make it fully inclusive! Learn how to get started with the [Community Forum Creation Contributing.md](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DIjwmAyLnzvcTL1yaQaPsJ2LCXMSuYPdNDdEgDFh3a0/edit)

## Communication channels

## Monthly Calls
Meetings with be set two times per month (one evening/one morning to work across time zones) for teams to connect, provide updates, and check in on plans moving forward.
Meeting Minutes will be LINKED here once we get started.

## Community Forum (COMING SOON!!!) 
You guessed it! An integral piece to this first stage of the project is to create a discussion forum for individuals to connect, whether curricula writers, developers, teachers, or students - the discussion forum will be a place for people to connect, share resources, and build community no matter location.  We need your help to get this started. Check out the [Community Forum Contributing.md](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DIjwmAyLnzvcTL1yaQaPsJ2LCXMSuYPdNDdEgDFh3a0/edit) to contribute to this project.

## Google Docs
For this project, all curricula, how-toâ€™s, templates will be created and edited through Google Docs. 

Commenting - Docs will have settings set to Commenting for files across the project.  Through this, add comments and suggestions and tag others to bring issues to their attention.

Suggesting - Once you are on a curriculum team working you will be given Editing Access to the doc.  During the initial edits, we ask that you use Suggesting mode so others can easily see the changes made.  As a team, suggestions will be reviewed and accepted or edited. See below for more details in how-to use Google Docs.

If you have trouble accessing a file, email [Katie](katie.sanfilippo@chicktech.org) for help.
