## How to report bugs

Please stay on the lookout for any potential issues that may cause problems with the curricula or discussion forum.  This could be content omissions or copy errors or issues with the design and functionality of the discussion forum.

We invite all contributors to report bugs, so "debugging" or fixing problems happens quickly and with the input of the community. Take a look at Atom's example for how to teach people to report bugs to your project.
