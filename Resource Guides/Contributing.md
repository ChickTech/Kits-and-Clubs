Make sure to check out the [Kits-and-Clubs Contributing.md](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bc_G5qWdX8DPIrOyLwAEqspExM6VsD9_l62YZnruIsQ/edit) for a full understanding of our Code of Conduct, Timeline, and vision for the project.

There are so many wonderful resources and curricula out there that can support educators in lesson planning and club activities.  The Club-in-a-Bok Kits will include guides of approved resources that meet ChickTechâ€™ criteria in providing hands-on project activities to a diverse and inclusive audience.

### Do you have existing curricula or resources that may be included in the kits? 

Link them [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16IDwcdyiWF1-PtW20KwgmUY71BqpWnRLKaMfZ4aM0d8/edit) to be reviewed by the Curricula team and potentially incorporated into the Kits.

### What should the Resource Guide Criteria be?

Add suggestions for the criteria list [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19kGSQ_Od_P4a4dEabrpo1GXDWiYF2Vbe8d3g1b6hePA/edit).  Criteria should ensure that all resources provided in the kits support accommodations for students and teachers in order to make lessons accessible for all.  This may be through adaptations, language promoting diversity and inclusion, and hands-on activities.
