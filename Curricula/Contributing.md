A full list of Curricula Revison Contributing Guidelines is found [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wW-mWtxwgFaqc-d-cMUlkLY0fG_w42Rw1fBX9sNjlH4/edit)

Be sure to check out the ChickTech Club and Kits Open [Project Contributing Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bc_G5qWdX8DPIrOyLwAEqspExM6VsD9_l62YZnruIsQ/edit) for a full summary of our Code of Conduct, project timelines, and other ways to get involved.

A few ways to get started: 

## Share this [SURVEY](https://chicktechorg.typeform.com/to/QreXXG) with the educators in your life - informal & formal.  

Please also take survey to share your ideas and feedback!

This will help to collect feedback from educators on what is most needed from the Club-in-a-Box Kits and accommodations that need to be made.

## Curricula Criteria and Accommodations

In order to make the curriculum provided in the ChickTech Club-in-a-Box accessible for everyone, we need to list what adjustments need to be made. Copies of the current curricula can be found in the [Curricula Contributing.md](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wW-mWtxwgFaqc-d-cMUlkLY0fG_w42Rw1fBX9sNjlH4/edit). 

1. Suggest Criteria and Target Accommodations for Curriculum used in the Club-in-a-Box Kits to our [brainstorming page](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w9NYpu5pyuVeMl5rDCKDOmXlLwFJWab25vK_tIRTYpQ/edit#gid=0). 

2. Create Google Doc Templates for the following curricula template adaptations:
   
   - After-School Clubs
   
        Workshops broken up into 4 - 8 week long series
   
   - (1) day Workshops
   
        Shorten workshops into 5-hour lessons
        
     These templates should be created in a Google Doc and linked [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wW-mWtxwgFaqc-d-cMUlkLY0fG_w42Rw1fBX9sNjlH4/edit).  Once this is complete, add the Template to the Issue Tracker for review.
   
## Editing Current Curricula

1. Comment on which curriculum you will be working on in the [Curricula Contributing Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wW-mWtxwgFaqc-d-cMUlkLY0fG_w42Rw1fBX9sNjlH4/edit). 

2. Review existing curriculum and add suggestions to make sure it complies with criteria and target accommodations.

Tag [Katie](katie.sanfilippo@chicktech.org) by commenting +katie.sanfilippo@chicktech.org in the Google Doc to be given edit access.

Once you receive edit acess, turn on Suggesting mode in the upper right corner.

You’re good to go! Make suggestions and comments in ways to make the curricula adaptable for 5-hour workshops and After-School programs, as well as accommodations to make it accessible for all. Once finished, make a note in the Github Issue Tracker to bring it up for review. 

### Key Points to Consider in Curricula Revisions

    Can this be done offline?

    In what ways can this be made available with poor or no internet connection?

    Does this provide accommodations for students with different able-bodiness?

    Is this adaptable for students of different levels of experience in….

## Team Review of Curricula Templates and Suggestions

Once current curricula is individually reviewed and edits suggested, teams will work together to review the suggestions and provide feedback.  This will be done in the regular monthly calls on a rolling basis.  Once suggestions have been peer-reviewed, we can start working to finalize curricula.

## Input revised curricula into templates
Ensure curricula is following the templates. This is a great way to ensure nothing is left out of the lesson plans. 

Find Templates [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wW-mWtxwgFaqc-d-cMUlkLY0fG_w42Rw1fBX9sNjlH4/edit) once they've been completed.

## Create Teacher Guidelines and Resources Lists for each workshop

Once we have our curricula tailored to meet the needs of different models and students, let’s support the educators by providing faciliator notes and tips in the curricula. Link any and all resources in the document that will be useful for educators as they bring this curricula to their students.
